h1. AKKA 2.0-M1 REMOTING EXAMPLE

Example application for how to use Akka 2.0-M1 remoting.

The example consists of two parts:
* 1 - example of remote lookup of actors and,
* 2 - example of remote creation of actors

In case 1 we will use an CalculatorApplication that has the actor containing the "business logic" (which
in this case is either addition of subtraction of integers in the actor SimpleCalculatorActor).

In case 2 we will use the same CalculatorApplication but instead of using an already existing actor we will
remote deploy an actor which contains "advanced" calculation operations such as multiplication or division.

So to recap, the example contains 3 actor systems:
* CalculatorApplication (CA): number cruncher that waits for messages, acts upon them and sends back the results
* LookupApplication         : looks up an existing actor on the CA and sends messages to it
* CreationApplication       : deploys a new actor on CA and sends messages to this new actor on the remote CA node

All services run in their own ActorSystem and although they all run on the same physical machine (127.0.0.1) in this
example it is really easy to change this to also have it run on different machines.

To run this example you have to have SBT installed. Once this is fulfilled you just do the following.
Download the example, e.g. >git clone git@github.com:henrikengstrom/Akka2Remote.git
This will download it into a folder called "Akka2Remote" and you should "cd" into that folder next.

h2. RUNNING CASE 1 : Lookup of remote actors
The next step is to run SBT:

$ sbt
[info] Loading global plugins from /Users/usr/.sbt/plugins
[info] Loading project definition from /Users/usr/code/Akka2Remote/project
[info] Set current project to akka2remote (in build file:/Users/usr/code/Akka2Remote/)
> run

Multiple main classes detected, select one to run:

 1] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CalcApp
 2] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.LookupApp
 3] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CreationApp

Enter number:

Start of by running the calculator application, i.e. "1". This will start the application and wait for messages.
You should see something like this:

[info] Running org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CalcSrv
[INFO] [12/22/2011 11:53:14.907] [run-main] [Remote] Starting remote server on [akka://CalculatorService@127.0.0.1:2552]
Started Calculator Application - waiting for messages

Okay, next we need a new SBT instance to run the lookup application, so start a new terminal window and type

$ sbt
[info] Loading global plugins from /Users/usr/.sbt/plugins
[info] Loading project definition from /Users/usr/code/Akka2Remote/project
[info] Set current project to akka2remote (in build file:/Users/usr/code/Akka2Remote/)
> run

Multiple main classes detected, select one to run:

 1] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CalcApp
 2] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.LookupApp
 3] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CreationApp

Enter number:

This time you should select the "LookupApp" which in this case is number 2.
When this is done you should see something similar to this:

[info] Running org.h3nk3.akka.remote.LookupApp
[INFO] [12/22/2011 11:55:21.622] [run-main] [Remote] Starting remote server on [akka://LookupApplication@127.0.0.1:2553]
Started Lookup Application
Sub result: 43 - 94 = -51
Sub result: 14 - 86 = -72
Add result: 77 + 58 = 135
and so on...

h2. RUNNING CASE 2: Creation of actors on a remote node

Make sure that the "CalculatorApplication" is running (see the first part of RUNNING CASE 1 above).

Start a new terminal window and type:

$ sbt
[info] Loading global plugins from /Users/usr/.sbt/plugins
[info] Loading project definition from /Users/usr/code/Akka2Remote/project
[info] Set current project to akka2remote (in build file:/Users/usr/code/Akka2Remote/)
> run

Multiple main classes detected, select one to run:

 1] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CalcApp
 2] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.LookupApp
 3] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CreationApp

Enter number:

Select "CreationApp" which in this case is number 3.
Now you should see something like this:

[info] Running org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CreationApp
[INFO] [12/22/2011 11:57:08.899] [run-main] [Remote] Starting remote server on [akka://RemoteCreation@127.0.0.1:2554]
Started Creation Application
Div result: 9158 / 50 = 183.00
Div result: 7573 / 24 = 315.00
Mul result: 6 * 15 = 90
Mul result: 5 * 0 = 0
and so on...

If you switch between the terminal windows you will see that the all 3 actor systems are running at once.
The example applications run forever, or at least until the power sources of the earth are exhausted,
so you should probably just stop them from running that long with a CTRL-C.

Good luck with the hAKKing!
