Example application for how to use Akka 2.0-M1 remoting.

The example contains 3 services:
* CalculatorService (CS): number cruncher service that waits for messages, acts upon them and sends back the results
* LookupService         : looks up an existing actor on the CS and sends messages to it
* CreationService       : deploys a new actor on CS and sends messages to this new actor on the remote CS node

All services run in their own ActorSystem and although they all run on the same physical machine (127.0.0.1) in this
example it is really easy to change this to also have it run on different machines.

To run this example you have to have SBT installed. Once this is fulfilled you just do the following.
Download the example, e.g. >git clone git@github.com:henrikengstrom/Akka2Remote.git
This will download it into a folder called "Akka2Remote" and you should "cd" into that folder next.
The next step is to run SBT:

$ sbt
[info] Loading global plugins from /Users/usr/.sbt/plugins
[info] Loading project definition from /Users/usr/code/Akka2Remote/project
[info] Set current project to akka2remote (in build file:/Users/usr/code/Akka2Remote/)
> run

Multiple main classes detected, select one to run:

 [1] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CalcSrv
 [2] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.LookupApp
 [3] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CreationApp

Enter number:

Start of by running the calculator service, i.e. "1". This will start the service and wait for messages.
You should see something like this:

[info] Running org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CalcSrv
[INFO] [12/22/2011 11:53:14.907] [run-main] [Remote] Starting remote server on [akka://CalculatorService@127.0.0.1:2553]
Started Calculator Service - waiting for messages

Okay, next we need a new SBT instance to run the lookup application, so start a new terminal window and type

$ sbt
[info] Loading global plugins from /Users/usr/.sbt/plugins
[info] Loading project definition from /Users/usr/code/Akka2Remote/project
[info] Set current project to akka2remote (in build file:/Users/usr/code/Akka2Remote/)
> run

Multiple main classes detected, select one to run:

 [1] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CalcSrv
 [2] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.LookupApp
 [3] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CreationApp

Enter number:

This time you should select the "LookupApp" which in this case is number 2.
When this is done you should see something similar to this:

[info] Running org.h3nk3.akka.remote.LookupApp
[INFO] [12/22/2011 11:55:21.622] [run-main] [Remote] Starting remote server on [akka://LookupApplication@127.0.0.1:2552]
Started Lookup Application
Sub result: 43 - 94 = -51
Sub result: 14 - 86 = -72
Add result: 77 + 58 = 135
and so on...

If you want to you can also run the creation application at the same time.
Start a new terminal window and type:
$ sbt
[info] Loading global plugins from /Users/usr/.sbt/plugins
[info] Loading project definition from /Users/usr/code/Akka2Remote/project
[info] Set current project to akka2remote (in build file:/Users/usr/code/Akka2Remote/)
> run

Multiple main classes detected, select one to run:

 [1] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CalcSrv
 [2] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.LookupApp
 [3] org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CreationApp

Enter number:

Select "CreationApp" which in this case is number 3.
Now you should see something like this:

[info] Running org.h3nk3.akka.remote.CreationApp
[INFO] [12/22/2011 11:57:08.899] [run-main] [Remote] Starting remote server on [akka://RemoteCreation@127.0.0.1:2554]
Started Creation Application
Div result: 9158 / 50 = 183.00
Div result: 7573 / 24 = 315.00
Mul result: 6 * 15 = 90
Mul result: 5 * 0 = 0
and so on...

If you switch between the terminal windows you will see that the all run in parallel, 2 "applications" and one service.
The examples run forever, or at least until the power sources of the earth are exhausted, so you should probably just
stop them from running that long with a CTRL-C.

Good luck with the hAKKing!
